<p>The Mentioner acknowledges that there exists <strong>no legal, ethical, or moral recourse</strong> to challenge this agreement while it remains in effect. Any attempt to do so will result in further punitive alterations to The Mentioner’s profile, at the sole discretion of The Enforcer.  </p>
<h3 id="-article-v-expiration-and-renewal-"><strong>Article V - Expiration and Renewal</strong></h3>
<p>Upon expiration of the six (6) month term, The Mentioner may regain control of their display name and profile picture <strong>unless</strong> they mention The Enforcer again, at which point a new six (6) month term will immediately take effect.  </p>
